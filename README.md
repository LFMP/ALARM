# ALARM

The ALARM platform aims to dynamically and automatically recommend links that are relevant to web page browsers. In addition, the proposed platform provides a website monitoring tool to help owners / publishers visualize referrer activities, as well as assist them in metric-based evaluation (efficiency, number of links generated by referrers, amount of accesses in these, etc).
A mechanism for creating recommendations was also provided. With this, along with the evaluation of the recommendations, the editor is given the possibility to improve the existing algorithms. This way, it guarantees a greater autonomy on the part of the users of the platform, since not necessarily an update of the platform has to be made for use of new recommendations.
